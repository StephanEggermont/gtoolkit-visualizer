This is an implementation of the Kamada-Kawai force-directed algorithm. The algorithm was designed witht he intention of laying out general undirected graphs. It is a spring algorithm whose  main idea is that graph theoretic distances between vertices in a graph is related to the geomentri distances between them in the drawing.
