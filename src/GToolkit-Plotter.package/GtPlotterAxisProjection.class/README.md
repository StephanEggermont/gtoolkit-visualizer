I represent a projection value  of a domain object on the axis.

Given a Point (20@30) as a domain object and euclidian coordinate system.
Then projection of that point on continuous X-Axis would be 20 and projection on Y-axis would be 30.

A projection of a domain object on discrete axis is an index of that object in a data set
