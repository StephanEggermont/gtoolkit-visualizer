I represent a range of values along the axis.
A range is defined by minimum and maximum values. However, it does not necessary mean that range is fixed. 
Values outside of range excluding min / max are not displayed on the plot.

All ranges except ==GtPlotterComputedRange== play a role of Range definition, while ComputedRange is bound to some specific data
